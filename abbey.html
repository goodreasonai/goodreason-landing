            Hello all,<br/><br/>
            Unfortunately, Abbey will be shutting down on June 15th.
            It just costs too much to run, and there are many wonderful alternatives you can try out.<br/><br/>
            Before it's gone, I'd like to thank the many users who have spent time on the platform I created. You learned with Abbey - or cheated on assignments, or something else. Thank you.<br/><br/>
            If you're a bit tech savvy, note that the code to Abbey has been open sourced (see <a href="https://github.com/goodreasonai/abbey">here</a>).
            Any developer can choose to host Abbey for himself or for others.<br/><br/>
            I've tried to wait until our peak season is over (finals season), but in so far as Abbey's discontinuation inconveniences you, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>
            Best,<br/>
            Gordon
